This program was created for educational purposes and I am not responsible for its illegal use . 
Program when opened will disable any input to computer, start playing music and go make some squers with your cursor.
When finishen the blue window will apear and when trying to close, it will shutdown your computer.
Only way to close program without shuting down computer is pressing "END"
Also program is using lots of memory becouse ist have very high fps limit (this was on purpose).
To run the project open as an administrator RUNME.exe
